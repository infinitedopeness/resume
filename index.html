<em>Infinite Dopeness</em/>
I dedicate my life to the light. My reflection ever becoming a reflection of divine. I strive to be in the moment - where every good thing in life happens. 

<p>
Everyone and every creation is my teacher. *I forgive quickly and completely. My life is a gift, a miracle so great I could never be deserving. I live in abundance and measure success in terms of contribution to a world of which I will surely pass.
</p>

<p>
 I seek to understand and enhance the world around me through increasing understanding through dialogue and gift culture.

<p>
Simply put; Humans alternate from helpless crying poopsacks to fully functioning ambassadors of god, frequencies generally varying somewhere between.
