<main>The one thing I can’t seem to get out of my head is the thought, “YOU may be the last resort in the determination of whether someone lives or died. I’m frankly tired of feeling this weight as I’ve watched societies most vulnerable citizens re-traumatized. 

Many causes of initial trauma are societal and these precurses will not fully be undone in a 7 - 30 or 90 day bed; but, understanding the causes of initial state during intake could reduce the number or lost lives that are preventable and inevitable under the current conditions. 

War’s dismemberment of limbs, industrial racism fortified by the world prison-industrial complex, medicine’s continual failure to cure mental sickness, dying worshippers of the dicGoddess heroin’s abd ger diatiesk command for  undivided attention, multi-generational poverty, victims of sex-trafficking, active prostitutes - in essence = the unloved.  All comrades under state funding - a tent. 

The weight of human’s value is not measured in potential. Societies nod to atheism can be summed in a spreadsheet column in the Red - God places humans in the black and the least of embicles can practice salvation by valuing their fellow man to some degree. And to the degree a maker of morality even base understanding of grace. 

The foresmost Judeo Christian principle is marked in Genesis revelation of the first murder Cain. God begs in the first question ever asked - the earlies marked question of Diety to Man - Man begs back, “Am I my brother’s keeper ?” Herien a divide - God or Man - Brother’s Keeper or Killer.
